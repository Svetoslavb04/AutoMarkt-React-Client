# Automarkt | simple eCommerce React App

## Live demo

Go to https://automarkt-react-client.firebaseapp.com

## Development
Automarkt uses a custom REST API (for educational purposes). The back-end was made with NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, Mongoose and AWS SDK. It uses an HTTP-only cookie containing a JWT token for authentication. The design idea was from a template with a few changes and was implemented from scratch by me using Material UI and SCSS. For deployment, I have used Firebase Hosting (with CI setup) and for the REST API - Heroku.
